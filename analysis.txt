'Analysis of CRIM and AGE

The relationship between CRIM (crime rate) and AGE (proportion of houses built before 1940) was explored using a scatter plot and the correlation matrix.

Observations:

	•	The scatter plot shows a positive trend between CRIM and AGE, indicating that towns with a higher proportion of older housing units tend to have higher crime rates.
	•	This relationship suggests that as the age of housing increases (higher AGE values), the crime rate also increases in those areas.

Correlation Coefficient:

	•	The correlation plot reveals a positive correlation between CRIM and AGE, with a moderate strength (approximately +0.4).
	•	A correlation value in this range suggests that the relationship is not perfect but still noticeable.

Possible Explanation:
Older housing units might be associated with:

	1.	Lower socio-economic conditions: Towns with older infrastructure may have fewer resources for renovation and community development, potentially leading to higher crime rates.
	2.	Population Density: Older neighborhoods may be more densely populated, which can correlate with increased crime rates.
	3.	Urban Decay: Areas with older housing might experience urban decline, leading to socio-economic challenges and higher crime rates.

Conclusion:
There is a clear positive correlation between CRIM and AGE, indicating that towns with older housing tend to experience higher crime rates. This trend could reflect socio-economic factors and infrastructure challenges in these areas.'
